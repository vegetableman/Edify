### Context

Relies explicitly on `Provider`, `Consumer` and `UseContext` to propagate store state

## Store

Each module uses it's own store. The store allows subscription to interested parties allowing state changes to be passed.

## CSS Modules

CSS Modules allow for a cleaner way of separating name conflicts and help us use good old CSS, instead of JS.
